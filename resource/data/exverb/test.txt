Discriminative learning methods , such as Maximum Entropy Markov Models, Projection Based Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, Sequence AdaBoost, Sequence Perceptron, Hidden Markov Support Vector Machines and Maximum-Margin Markov Networks, overcome the limitations of HMMs.
Electronically available multi-modal data is unprecedented in terms of its volume, variety, velocity, (and veracity).
Mining scientific data for patterns and relationships has been a common practice for decades , and the very simple use of self-mutating genetic algorithms is nothing new , either . 
The development of compositional distributional models of semantics reconciling the empirical aspects of distributional semantics with the compositional aspects of formal semantics is a popular topic in the contemporary literature.

In this paper we present a general natural language processing system called CARAMEL . 
The guide contains dead links and omits sites.
This paper shows that the output of state of the art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions . 
In this paper, we present, validate, and implements a general natural language processing system called CARAMEL . 
he go downstairs quickly and eat an apple.
The model is independent of any particular set of relations and uses an extended definition for semantic relations.

In this paper, the data is a collection of sentences, each of which contains a number of target verbs and other annotations.
Paris is located in French.

We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora.
LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics.
Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities.
In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document.
We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation.
We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.
