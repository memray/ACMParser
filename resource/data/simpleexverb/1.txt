The paper presents a statistical approach to automatic building of translation lexicons from parallel corpora. We briefly describe the pre-processing steps, a baseline iterative method, and the actual algorithm. The evaluation for the two algorithms is presented in some detail in terms of precision, recall and processing time. We conclude by briefly presenting some of our applications of the multilingual lexicons extracted by the method described herein.
